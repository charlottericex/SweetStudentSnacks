## Ingredients 

* 225g butter, softened
* 110g caster sugar
* 275g plain flour

## Method 

STEP 1

Heat the oven to a 190C/170C fan.

STEP 2  

Cream the butter in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or a stand mixer until it is soft. Add the sugar and keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. Sift in the flour and add any optional ingredients if you’re using them. Bring the mixture with your hands in a figure-of-eight motion until it forms a dough. 

STEP 3

Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them slightly apart from each other on a baking sheet. Flatten the balls a little with the palm of your hand and bake them in the oven for around 10-12 mins until they are golden brown and slightly firm on top. Leave the cookies on a cooling rack for about 15 mins before serving.
