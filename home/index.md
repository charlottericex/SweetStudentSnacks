My name is Charlotte Rice, and I am a fellow university student with a sweet tooth – just like you! I
initially decided to create this book to bring colour into my life, I have always loved baking, but I also
needed to budget and struggled to do both. So, I designed this book to inspire those who love sweet
treats, especially student-friendly ones!
